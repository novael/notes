* **TV show tracker** Got a favorite show you don't want to miss? Don't have a DVR, or want to be able to find the show to then DVR later?  Make an application which can search various online TV Guide sites, locate the shows/times/channels, and add them to a database application.  The database/website then can send you email/text reminders that a show is about to start and which channel it will be on.
* **Time entry system**
* **File Explorer** Create your own simple windows explorer program.  Add feature(s) you always thought were missing from MS Windows Explorer, or Mac Finder.
