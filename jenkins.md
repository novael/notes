Running Jenkins as a service
----------------------------
* Create a jenkins user
* Download jenkins.war to jenkins home directory
* Download UBUNTU shell script to run jenkins as a service
* Place shell script in /etc/init.d (ensure execute privileges are granted)
* Reboot the system (if the service is not running, check the run-level configuration for the script)
